VIT'ian GPA and CGPA Calculator

Overview of the project :
The "VIT'ian GPA and CGPA Calculator" is a simple and a effective tool for the students to track their progress in their academic journey. We the students of VIT face hardships in undertsanding and calculating our Grade Points Average and Cumulative Grade points Average because of the 'Relative Grading System'. So I have designed this VIT'an GPA and CGPA Calculator to make the calculations of Grade Points Average and Cumulative Grade Points Average easier for the students, This system takes the user's semester marks, Attendance percentage and the class average of their class and returns the GPA of the current semestser and it allows the user to either continue the calculation of GPA and CGPA for the consecution or terminates with the current CGPA. I have applied the concepts I've learnt in this course and have desinged this project which makes is easy for the students of VIT to calculate their grades manully.

Features :
1. USER INPUTS :
   The system allows the user to input their marks, attendance percentage and class average for multiple semesters.
2. RELATIVE GRADING :
   As the Theory courses in VIT go with Relative grading I have brought that logic inside the program where the system with the    help of the class average and standard deviaton maps your mark with its respective grade by relative grading.
3. VALIDATION :
   The system validates whether the inputs entered by the user and then performs the calculations to give the accurate results.
4. OUTPUT:
   The System diaplays the course credits, grades along with their grade points, GPA and CGPA and allows the user to continue      the calculations for multiple semesters.
5. MULTIPLE SEMESTER :
   The system supports Multiple semester data entry that is the user can calculate all their 8 semester's grade or it even       has the options to stop inbetween for the convienent use of the student.

Tools used :
1. Language : Python 
2. Development environment : Jupyter Notebook
3. Output User Interface : Jupyter Notebook
4. Module : IPSP_Project_VIT_GPA_CGPA_Calculator 
5. Function : GPA_calculator
6. Concepts used : Modules, functions, Conditional statements such as : if, elif, else, nested if, Iterative statements such as for loop, Jump statements, Advanced data types such as : lists.

Steps to run the program :
1. The source code is added in the repository with the name "IPSP_Project_VIT_GPA_CGPA_Calculator".
2. The souce code can be executed in any platform that can run a python program.
3. The file has to downloaded and then opened in any Python code executing platform (Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, VS code)
4. And then the user has to follow the guidelines given which will help the user to calculate their GPA and CGPA
5. The system allows the user to calculate GPA and CGPA of multiple semester either the user can continue with multiple semesters of terminate after every calculation

Instructions to test :
1. The system can be tested with any inputs entered by the user.
2. Even if the inputs given are invalid the systems returns an error message
3. I have already tested with the system with multiple marks and grades and verified it with my mentor and peer group.

Conclusion :

This project is designed to help the students of VIT to calculate their Grades, GPA and CGPA to track their progress in their academic journey, hereby I conclude that this project was completed created by what I have learnt in this course and it doesn't contain any LLM's content. This project has helped me gain practical knowledge, I have learnt to apply my theoretical knowledge of pythom programming language to solve the real world problems.
