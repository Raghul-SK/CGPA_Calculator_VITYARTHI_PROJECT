PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
We, the students of VIT often face difficulties in understanding and manually calculating our semester GPA and CGPA due to diverse assessments and numerous subjects in a particular semester. Without VTOP calculating our GPA and CGPA would be a hectic job, so I have created this “VIT’ian GPA and CGPA Calculator” as the solution for this trouble. The aim of this project is to create a calculator that takes the relative grading into account and delivers instant and reliable results. 

Scope of the project :
1. Funtional scope :
   The system allows the user to enter their marks and attendance percentage for multiple semesters.
   The system then validates the inputs entered by the user
   The valid inputs are processed and the GPA IS calculates using GPA = (SUM(Course credits x Grade points))/Total credits.
   And the CGPA is calculated using, CGPA = (SUM(GPA x Total credits for that semester))/Total credits completed till date.
   The results (GPA and CGPA) are diplayed finally along with their Grades and grade points.

2. Non functional scope :
   The system is user friendly and the instructions are made simpler to help the user.
   The system shall not take more than 2 seconds for the calculation and displaying the outputs.
   The system shall be avaliable anywhere and anytime for the user to calculate their GPA and CGPA.

Target Audience : Students, Teachers and Administrators who need to calculate the GPA and CGPA.

High level features :
1. Relative grading : The system uses the relative grading system that is the marks are mapped to its respective grade according to their class average and standard deviation
2. Multiple semester support : The user can either stop with the calculation of first semester's GPA or continue till the very last semester's GPA and CGPA.
3. Trasperancy : The system displays the results after each and every calculation not just the finals results for the user's conivinience.
